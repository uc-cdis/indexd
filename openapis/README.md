## Swagger Tools

Use swagger's editor to update swagger.yaml and swagger.json using one of the following:
* [online editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) 
* [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/swaggerapi/swagger-editor/) - `docker run -d -p 80:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-editor`
* or pull the editor code from [github](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor), and `npm start` an editor locally.

Publish API documentation with the [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) - also easily launched with docker: `docker run -p 80:8080 -e SWAGGER_JSON=/foo/swagger.json -v /bar:/foo swaggerapi/swagger-ui`

As of writing this the latest spec defining the structure and elements of a swagger.yaml file is [version 3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md).
