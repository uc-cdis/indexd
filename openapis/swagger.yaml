            bundle contains other bundles, those other bundles are not recursively
            included in the result.

            If true and the object_id refers to a bundle, then the entire set of objects
            in the bundle is expanded. That is, if the bundle contains aother bundles,
            then those other bundles are recursively expanded and included in the result.
            Recursion continues through the entire sub-tree of the bundle.
            If the object_id refers to a blob, then the query parameter is ignored.

          The checksum of the DrsObject. At least one checksum must be provided.
          For blobs, the checksum is computed over the bytes in the blob.
          For bundles, the checksum is computed over a sorted concatenation of the
          checksums of its top-level contained objects (not recursive, names not included).
          The list of checksums is sorted alphabetically (hex-code) before concatenation
          and a further checksum is performed on the concatenated checksum value.
          For example, if a bundle contains blobs with the following checksums:
          md5(blob1) = 72794b6d
          md5(blob2) = 5e089d29
          Then the checksum of the bundle is:
          md5( concat( sort( md5(blob1), md5(blob2) ) ) )
          = md5( concat( sort( 72794b6d, 5e089d29 ) ) )
          = md5( concat( 5e089d29, 72794b6d ) )
